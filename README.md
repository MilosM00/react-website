# Rubic Website

### THIS IS ONLY FOR LEARNING AND PORTFOLIO PURPOSES!

### How is this website created?
I downloaded a template for this site and start to codding manually. <br />
Just like you painting some image. You look at the image that you want to paint and start painting on your blank page. <br />
Of course, I changed some things to make the website better. <br />

And I think that this is the best way to exercise your skill. <br />

If you search right now you can find the template that I used. <br />
I hope that I clear that out.
